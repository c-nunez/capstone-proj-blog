This project is for a basic blogging application using Node, EJS, Javascipt, Bootsrap, and Express. None of the posts are saved beyond the session as it does not utilize a database.

The project is meant show functionality in allowing the user to create, edit, and delete blog posts. In edition to the project requirements, I've added date tagging for each post.
